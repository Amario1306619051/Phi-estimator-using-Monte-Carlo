    "### Conclusion: Estimating Pi Using Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we employed the Monte Carlo simulation method to estimate the value of pi. By randomly generating points within a square and calculating the ratio of points falling inside a quarter circle inscribed in the square, we approximated the value of pi.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Number of points for increased accuracy\n",

    "print(f\"Improved estimated value of pi after {num_points} trials is: {improved_estimated_pi}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After increasing the number of points to 100,000, we obtained an estimate that closely approaches the value of pi, around 3.14. This outcome demonstrates the principle that as we use more points, our estimation becomes more accurate and converges towards the actual value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimating pi using the Monte Carlo simulation provides insight into how random sampling can be used to solve mathematical problems. By adjusting the number of points, we can control the trade-off between computational resources and the accuracy of our estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Monte Carlo method offers a versatile approach to approximating complex values like pi, making it a valuable tool for various applications in mathematics, science, and engineering.\n",
